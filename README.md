# User-Registration-Using-Google-Oath

Open Authorization (OAuth) is a service that allows websites or apps to share user information with other websites without being given a users password. Users can log in to multiple websites with the same account without creating other credentials.

I learned this project from here https://www.section.io/engineering-education/django-google-oauth/
